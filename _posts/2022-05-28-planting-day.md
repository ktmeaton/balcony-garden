I am gardening on my own for the first time ever! I have never been succesful at keeping a plant alive for more than a month, so this time I'm trying a few different things.

1. **I'm directly sowing seeds _outside_**. We have a west-facing balcony and it gets HOT during the day ðŸŒž.
1. **I'm using _proper planters_ and _potting soil_**. No more grocery store herbs in fragile plastic containers and sad soil.
1. **I've done my research**. I spent 4-6 hours reading about planting and proper care.

In hindsight, the morning of May 28, 2022 was not an ideal day to plant seeds on a balcony garden. It was EXTREMELY windy, and I lost about 25% of my parsnip seeds ðŸ˜¢ to the wind. Hopefully that will make some hungry birds day though.

On a whim, I decided to try and grow a few plants from kitchen scraps:

- **6 `garlic` cloves**. Fingers-crossed I got the orientation correct ðŸ™ƒ.
- **7 `green onion` bulbs**. These are easy to grow in a water glass.
- **3 `tomato` slices** which is a funny technique [I read about the night before](https://www.gardeningknowhow.com/edible/vegetables/tomato/planting-tomato-slices.htm).

My `lettuce` and `pepper` seeds are also "mystery" seeds which I don't the variety or viabilitiy. I'm suddenly reminded of convenience store [candy that came in a "mystery" flavor](https://zomgcandy.com/airheads-white-mystery/). The rest of the seeds are described below.

## Plants

| Plant        | Planter        | Type  | Sprout       | Mature       | 
|:-------------|:---------------|:------| :------------|:-------------|
| Basil        | Large Pot      | Seed  | 7-14 days    | 85 days      |
| Beets        | Trough #2      | Seed  | 10-12 days   | 50-65 days   | 
| Carrots      | Balcony #1, #3 | Seed  | 14-21 days   | 80 days      |
| Garlic       | Trough #2      | Clove | 2-3 days     | 90-100 days  |
| Green Onion  | Balcony #1, #4 | Bulb  | 2-3 days     | 14-21 days   |
| Lettuce      | Balcony #2, #3 | Seed  | 7-14 days    | 40-50 days   |
| Parsnips     | Balcony #2, #4 | Seed  | 20-25 days   | 100-120 days |
| Peppers      | Trough #1      | Seed  | 7-21 days    | 60-90 days   |
| Onion        | Trough #1      | Seed  | 10-15 days   | 115-125      |
| Radish       | Small Pot      | Seed  | 5-7 days     | 22-70 days   |
| Tomatoes     | Large Pot      | Slice | 5-10 days    | 60-100 days  |

- All plants are from seeds except for `garlic` and `green onions`. 
- Sprout and maturation times come from the packets or the [How to Grow series](https://www.westcoastseeds.com/blogs/how-to-grow).

## Companion Planting

For almost all of the planters, I am using companion planting. From my research I found three major considerations:

1. **Physical**

    - Avoid putting large root vegetables together (ex. `carrots`, `parsnips`). 
    - Instead, pair shallow roots (ex. `lettuce`) with deep roots (ex. `carrots`).
    - Avoid putting "light-hungry" plants together (ex. `peppers`, `tomatoes`). 
    - Instead, pair ["shade-loving" plants](https://www.ecohome.net/guides/2295/growing-vegetables-in-the-shade) (ex. `lettuce`) with a nice leafy canopy (ex. `peppers`, `tomatoes`).

1. **Chemical**

    - Beans don't like the chemical `allicin` produced by `Onions`, as it can [stunt their growth](https://www.tinygardenhabit.com/can-onions-and-beans-be-planted-together/). 
    - Although some people [can make them work together](https://www.tinygardenhabit.com/can-onions-and-beans-be-planted-together/)!

1. **Biological**

    - Insect/parasite repellant qualities of one plant can benefit another! 
    - `Basil` is [known to repel flies and hornworms](https://www.masterclass.com/articles/tomato-companion-planting-guide#companion-plants-to-grow-with-tomatoes), which makes it a great protector for `tomatoes`.
    - On the other hand, parasites can spread between highly-similar plants. 
    - Onion-like plants (ex. `onions`, `garlic`, `shallots`) are [suspectible to maggots](https://www.gardeningknowhow.com/edible/vegetables/onion/onion-plant-companions.htm), and are best kept apart to reduce infection.

## Growing Season

The [growing season for Edmonton](https://www.almanac.com/gardening/frostdates/AB/Edmonton) is:

| Nearest Climate Station    | Altitude | Last Spring Frost | First Fall Frost | Growing Season |
|:---------------------------|:---------|:------------------|:-----------------|:---------------|
| EDMONTON CITY CENTRE A, AB | 2198'    | May 15            | Sep 16           | 123 days       | 

I am 13 days behind schedule, so we might be cutting it close for harvesting some of the root vegetables.

## Upcoming

- The next activity point is the `garlic` and `green onion` sprouting in `2-3 days`.
- After that is the `basil`, `lettuce`, `radish`, and `tomatoes` sprouting in `5-14 days`.
