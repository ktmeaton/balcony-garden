- For tomatoes, I am trying the [tomato slice method](https://www.gardeningknowhow.com/edible/vegetables/tomato/planting-tomato-slices.htm) for growing `tomatoes`.
- Sprout and maturation times come from the packets or West Coast Seeds' [How to Grow series](https://www.westcoastseeds.com/blogs/how-to-grow).
- Next time, I will not sow seeds on an extremely windy day. 25% of my parsnip seeds were lost to the wind!
- The `lettuce` and `pepper` are mystery seeds ðŸ˜Š I have no idea what variety they will grow.

## Plants

| Tomatoes     | Large Pot      | Slice | 5-10 days    | 60-100 days  |


## Companion Planting

For almost all of the planters, I am using companion planting. From my research I found three major considerations:

1. **Physical**

    - Avoid putting large root vegetables together (ex. `carrots`, `parsnips`). 
    - Instead, pair shallow roots (ex. `lettuce`) with deep roots (ex. `carrots`).
    - Avoid putting "light-hungry" plants together (ex. `peppers`, `tomatoes`). 
    - Instead, pair ["shade-loving" plants](https://www.ecohome.net/guides/2295/growing-vegetables-in-the-shade) (ex. `lettuce`) with a nice leafy canopy (ex. `peppers`, `tomatoes`).

1. **Chemical**

    - Beans don't like the chemical `allicin` produced by `Onions`, as it can [stunt their growth](https://www.tinygardenhabit.com/can-onions-and-beans-be-planted-together/). 
    - Although some people [can make them work together](https://www.tinygardenhabit.com/can-onions-and-beans-be-planted-together/)!

1. **Biological**

    - Insect/parasite repellant qualities of one plant can benefit another! 
    - `Basil` is [known to repel flies and hornworms](https://www.masterclass.com/articles/tomato-companion-planting-guide#companion-plants-to-grow-with-tomatoes), which makes it a great protector for `tomatoes`.
    - On the other hand, parasites can spread between highly-similar plants. 
    - Onion-like plants (ex. `onions`, `garlic`, `shallots`) are [suspectible to maggots](https://www.gardeningknowhow.com/edible/vegetables/onion/onion-plant-companions.htm), and are best kept apart to reduce infection.

## Growing Season

The [growing season for Edmonton](https://www.almanac.com/gardening/frostdates/AB/Edmonton) is:

| Nearest Climate Station    | Altitude | Last Spring Frost | First Fall Frost | Growing Season |
|:---------------------------|:---------|:------------------|:-----------------|:---------------|
| EDMONTON CITY CENTRE A, AB | 2198'    | May 15            | Sep 16           | 123 days       | 

## Upcoming

- The next activity point is the `garlic` and `green onion` sprouting in `2-3 days`.
- After that is the `basil`, `lettuce`, `radish`, and `tomatoes` sprouting in `5-14 days`.
