In the past I found adding and managing blog comments to be a huge pain. This was because of 2 reasons.

1. **Comments need to be stored in a database**. For a static blog site, a third-party provider needs to host the database. (ex. [Disqus](https://disqus.com/)).
1. **Comments cost money**. Although some providers have [free plans](https://disqus.com/pricing/) with restricted features.

However, I recently discovered a [blog post about Giscus](https://giscus.app/) which is a free, and open-source alternative using GitHub. As my blog is [already a GitHub repository](https://github.com/ktmeaton/balcony-garden) and is hosted through [GitHub pages](https://ktmeaton.github.io/balcony-garden/), this option was a no-brainer ðŸŽ‰! And even better, the [author](https://github.com/sylhare) of the [template I'm using](https://github.com/sylhare/Type-on-Strap) has already laid out the fundamentals for integration.

## Install

> Remember to enable issues and discussions in your repository settings!

1. Install the [giscus app](https://github.com/apps/giscus) to your blog GitHub repository: <https://github.com/apps/giscus>
1. [Configure](https://giscus.app) the giscuss app: <https://giscus.app>. I chose all the default options.
1. Add a `giscus` element to the `comments` section of `_config.yml`

    > The values for `repo-id` and `category-id` are provided when you [configure](https://giscus.app) the app.

    ```yaml
    # Comments
    comments:
      giscus:                                               # Enable by filling below information. For more info, go to https://giscus.app/
        repo: "ktmeaton/balcony-garden"                   # your public comments repository (e.g. owner/repo)
          repo-id: "R_kgDOHaVdEA"                           
          category: "Announcements"                          # Discussion category where comments are created
          category-id: "DIC_kwDOHaVdEM4CPWEA"
    ```

1. Create the file `_includes/social/giscus.liquid` to hold the script implementation.

    > Remove all backslashes!

    ```html
    <script src="https://giscus.app/client.js"
      data-repo="{\{ site.comments.giscus.repo \}}"
      data-repo-id="{\{ site.comments.giscus.repo-id }\}"
      data-category="{\{ site.comments.giscus.category }\}"
      data-category-id="{\{ site.comments.giscus.category-id }\}"
      data-mapping="pathname"
      data-reactions-enabled="1"
      data-emit-metadata="0"
      data-input-position="bottom"
      data-theme="light"
      data-lang="en"
      crossorigin="anonymous"
      async>
    </script>
    ```

1. Add to `_layouts/post.liquid`.

    > Remove all backslashes!

    ```html
    {\% if site.comments.giscus.repo and site.comments.giscus.repo-id and site.comments.giscus.category and site.comments.giscus.category-id \%} 
    {\% include social/giscus.liquid \%} 
    {\% endif \%}
    ```

## Usage

Giscus allows users to react to posts and post comments. However, users first need to be authenticated users of GitHub. Here is what an unauthenticated user will see.

{% include aligner.html images="2022-05-29/2022-05-29_giscus-signin.png" alt="Giscus requires signin for comments and reactions" column=1 %}

And this is what an authenticated user will see.
