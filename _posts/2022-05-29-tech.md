 I shot everything in 4k on my [iPad Mini 6](https://www.apple.com/ca/shop/buy-ipad/ipad-mini) and the photos are gorgeous! I knew I had to downsize them for my posts, so I initially tried 2000 px and then 720 px. Load times were still annoyingly slow, so I got some ideas from [an article on best image sizes for mobile sites](https://www.fosterwebmarketing.com/blog/the-best-image-size-for-desktop-and-mobile-websites.cfm). I wound up going with a horizontal resolution of 1440 px for full-size images that are meant to stretch across the whole screen. For a 2 column layout, each image is 720 px and for a 4 column layout, each image is 360 px. The feature image (1440 px) still loads really slowly, so I'll have to think about that more.

Up until recently, I had been using Adobe [Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/ca/products/photoshop.html) and [Illustrator](https://www.adobe.com/ca/products/illustrator.html) for all my graphic design projects. However, now that I'm not a student, I can't justify the license costs anymore. I was recently recommended [Affinity Photo](https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/designer/) and [Affinity Designer](https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/designer/) as affordable Adobe replacements and this is my first major project using them. So far, I'm 100% satisfied with Designer, which is what I used for all the photos in the <a href="../../../2022/05/28/planting-day.html">Garden | Day 0 | Planting </a> post.
