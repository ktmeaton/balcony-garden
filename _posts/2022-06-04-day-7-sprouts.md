I am extremely relieved that several seeds are sprouting ðŸ˜Š ! 

## Sprouts

As expected, the `radishes` and `green onions` were the first sprout. The `green onions` in Balcony \#1 had more growth than those in Balcony \#4, I wonder if that's because Balcony \#1:

1. Is the southernmost planter (more light).
1. Has `carrots` as a companion plant.
1. Has only 3 `green onion` bulbs (rather than 4).

It was a pleasant surprise that the `lettuce` in Balcony \#2 also had a few sprouts emerging.

## Watering

I've been watering all planters either 2 or 3 times a day, depending on weather conditions. In the mornings (8:00), the planters usually have a little bit of residual moisture, but are definitely not a "wet sponge". On sunny days, the top soil is baked completely dry by the afternoon (3:00), so I give them a little top-up. And then when the sun is setting after supper (8:00) I'll water again to hold them overnight.
